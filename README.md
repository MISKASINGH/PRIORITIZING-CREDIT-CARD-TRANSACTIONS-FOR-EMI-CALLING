# PRIORITIZING-CREDIT-CARD-TRANSACTIONS-FOR-EMI-CALLING
Our objective is to help the Bank prioritize its Credit Card transactions for EMI calling. We had to come up with a way to predict the probability that any given transaction will be converted into EMI so as to reduce the cost by reducing the number of callers by finding out the most probable people who'll take EMI Credit card transactions.
